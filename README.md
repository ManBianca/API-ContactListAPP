## Running and Testing API

* Write Tests: Postman allows to write tests for API requests, which can validate the response status, response time, and body content. This helps in automatically verifying that your API behaves as expected.
* The Contact List documentation contains 12 requests and all of them were achieved in Postman.
* Use Collection Runner: The Collection Runner in Postman can run all requests within a collection. This is useful for demonstrating the flow of API calls and their outcomes.
* The Contact List run results can be found [here](https://github.com/ManBianca/API-ContactListAPP/blob/main/ContactListAPP.postman_test_run.json).
* Share Collection Link: The Contact List collection can be found [here](https://github.com/ManBianca/API-ContactListAPP/blob/main/ContactListAPP.postman_collection.json).
